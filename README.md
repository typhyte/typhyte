## Hi, I'm Sammie!
I'm currently studying cybersecurity, and I also like programming in my free time!

I am currently confident in the following languages:
- Python
- Java

I am currently learning: 
- Rust

You'll mainly find projects here from school, and projects I've made in my off time for fun.
